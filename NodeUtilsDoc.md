# NodeUtils

The node utils library provides many useful functions. Many of these functions  perform general purpose ‘macro’ actions, for example, where you would usually write a for loop to get all of the nodes in a subtree and push them into an array, or write a loop to store all the fields belonging to a node, you can just use one of the functions in this library.

### Example Usage:
```javscript

// Create an instance of the NodeUtils object
var NU = new NodeUtils(); 
```

Now you can access all of the functions within it.

For example:
```javascript
// Will print the names of all nodes in the simulation
eon.Trace(NU.GetAllNodeNames(NU.GetAllNodes()));

//Disables all nodes starting from rootNode
NU.DisableNodes(NU.GetAllNodes(rootNode));
```
# Setting up

Include this in your includes field

Once included create an instance of the NodeUtils object in your script.
```javascript
var NU = new NodeUtils();
```
From now on, whenever you want to use the NodeUtils object use the instance (variable) name, e.g:
```javacript
NU.GetAllNodes();
```
NOTE: In the case of functions in the other and experimental sections you won’t need to use the NodeUtils object.

# Functions

GetSim
Returns the simulation node (regardless of name)

GetAllNodes
Returns an array of all of the nodes in the subtree, starting at a root node

GetAllNodeNames
Returns an array of all of the names of nodes in a list of nodes

CollectionToArray
Converts a collection object into an array

GetAllNodePaths
Returns an array of node paths (strings) in a subtree starting from a root node

compareNodes
Compares 2 nodes, returns true if they are the same node, false otherwise

swapNodes
Swaps two nodes in the simulation tree

swapRefs
Swaps the references in one field with another field of the same type, works for both single field and multiple field

EnableNodes
Enables all nodes in an array
Sets fields; Enabled, enabled, Enable, Active, active and SetRun to true
Sets field; SetRun_ to false

DisableNodes
Disables all nodes in an array (opposite of Enable nodes)
Sets fields; Enabled, enabled, Enable, Active, active and SetRun to false
Sets field; SetRun_ to true

GetNodesWithField
Returns an array of nodes possessing a certain field


GetNodesWithFields
Returns an array of nodes possessing all fields 

GetAllFields
Returns an array of all fields belonging to a node

GetAllFieldNames
Returns an array of all of the names (strings) of a list of fields

CopyToParent
Copies a node to its parent node

CopyToAllChildren
Copies a node to all of the children of a root node

MultCopy
Performs a eon.CopyNode multiple times
Works exactly like copy node, just add a number of copies you would like to create

hasRB
Checks to see if a node has a rigid body as a child (return true if found, false otherwise)

getFirstRBOfNode
Returns the first rigid body starting from a root node

GetNodeType
NOT IMPLEMENTED

# Other

calcDistance3D
Calculates the distance between two 3-dimensional points

midpoint3D
Calculates the midpoint of a line between two 3-dimensional points


# Experimental

depth
Returns the number (int) of levels deep a node is in the simulation tree

traverses
Returns the number of traverses required to reach a node using eon.FindNode (breadth first)
